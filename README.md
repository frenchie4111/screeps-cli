## Usage

The project is not currently being built into binaries (once it is a bit further
along development I will set up travis or something). To run:

Ensure Node Version `8.10.x` and `yarn` installed

```
git clone <repo url>
cd screeps-cli
yarn install
echo "<YOUR SCREEP API TOKEN>" > .screepscli
npm start
```
